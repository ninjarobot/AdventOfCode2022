Advent of Code 2022
========

_Farmer Edition_

I may regret this, but for this year's Advent of Code, I'm attempting to solve the problems using Farmer and deploying various cloud resources to solve the problem each day. This may go downhill really fast.

### Day 1
I'll need to process each row from a file, which sounds like a job for quick little container instances (each is an elf). But I don't want to run a ton of them or I'll hit my quota and cost a lot of money. Since the file is static, I'm going to embed it in the template to be passed to each container so they don't need to deal with any centralized storage.

I'm thinking recursion here because it's Advent of Code and that's what you do. Each container will accept some startup parameters:

* The line of the file they should work with
* The max value so far

The container (representing an elf) will read the line in the file. If it's the end of the file, the container will write to a file in the storage account Day1.solution.txt. If it's any other line in the file, it will try to parse the line into a number and compare it with the max value so far that it was passed and pass the maximum of those values to start another container, then run an ARM deployment to deploy a container replacing itself with new values for the line and max value.

This is going to make a lot of ARM deployments. I'm expecting a phone call.

#### Solution
* [Farmer script to generate ARM deployment](Day1.fsx)
* [Shell script (runs in an Azure container)](Day1.sh)

### Day 2
Day 1 took a while to troubleshoot the random issues that can happen redeploying an ACI container 250+ times, and I couldn't think of any ideas for neat Azure tricks, so I just did an F#-only solution for Day2.

#### Solution
* [fsi script](Day2.fsx)

### Day 3
All of these are going to be doing a lot of line by line processing, but doing a container each is really slow and fragile, so I'm going to change this up a bit. This time I'll make a single container, but it will be connected to an Application Insights workspace and use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send the solution for each line as a metric.

The chart shows the metrics, but I'll need to go to the logs to see the exact value.

All the metrics are named "error-priority" so I can aggregate on that. After the metrics come in, I can find the answer with a kusto query:

```
customMetrics
| where timestamp > ago(30m)
| where name == "error-priority"
| summarize sum(value)
```

The second part is roughly the same, but I'm using a new metric name - "badge-priority" - so I can differentiate the metrics from the two parts.

#### Solution
* [Farmer script to generate ARM deployment](Day3.fsx)
* [fsi script that emits OTel metrics](Day3.Script.fsx)
* [fsi script for part 2](Day3.ScriptPart2.fsx)

### Day 4

I'd like to scale out this one in a ridiculous way, so I'm going to make a shell script that can determine if there is overlap in a line and run a container per line. Then I'll sum up the number of healthy containers, which will be the ones that don't have any overlap.

ACI isn't going to cut it because there are 1000 lines in my input and I can only run 60 instances per container group. Kubernetes will let me run a lot of containers in a pod and then show me how many are healthy.

It will require a large AKS deployment YAML with each container getting a different line from my puzzle input, so I'll generate it.

![Just the right amount of failed containers](Day4.png)

As expected, many of the containers failed. Anywhere the line had overlap would exit, which means the count of running containers is the answer (582 for my input)!

#### Solution
* [fsi script to generate the AKS deployment and embed it in an ARM deployment](Day4.fsx)
* [Shell script that runs in each AKS container and fails if the ranges overlap](Day4.sh)
